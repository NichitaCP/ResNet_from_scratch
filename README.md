# [in_progress]

After learning PyTorch I wanted to challenge myself in building and implementing the ResNet architecture from scratch while making it customizable (changing the expansion/dilation factor of residual Blocks, the size of feature maps, etc). During the benchmarking, the implemented model achieved a 99.3% accuracy on Food classification images so I decided to do something more complicated and more useful - detecting skin cancer. You can visit the github link to see the architecture code and input/output testing. The project will be regularly updated
