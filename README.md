# ResNet from Scratch [WIP] 

This project implements the ResNet architecture from scratch using PyTorch. Initially tested on food classification, achieving 99.3% accuracy, it has been adapted for skin cancer detection.

## Features
- **Customizable ResNet Architecture**: Adjust expansion/dilation factors and feature map sizes.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Models available in the `models` folder.

## To-Do
- [ ] Retrain models in the `models` folder on longer epochs.
- [ ] Deploy the model using Streamlit.
- [ ] Test the deployed model on new images.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NichitaCP/ResNet_from_scratch
cd ResNet_from_scratch
```
